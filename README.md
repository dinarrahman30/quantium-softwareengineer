## Background
Meet your clients Soul Foods who have seen a decline in sales on their top performing candy product. With little more than a few requirements and a messy data set to reference, it’s time to take a swing at this project. While Quantium has a few core tech stacks they work with on a regular basis, a small interactive visualisation like this one is perfectly suited to the Dash framework. Dash is a Python framework for developing visual tools to interrogate data. It’s easy to use, quick to develop with, and results in a pretty finished product. Before you can get to work on the application itself, set up your local development environment for working with Dash. Your local development environment can be thought of as a workbench with all the tools necessary to progress on a project. Invest an adequate amount of time setting up a good workbench and development on any project will be made far easier.
